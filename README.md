This is a prank for the **Rayved Sun** server, because some of its members are so clueless that they canâ€™t even read this text themselves and have to rely on a translator, let alone read the whole code.ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚
